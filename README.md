# Portable-Air-quality-indicator---IoT-

The increase in the development of technology and the human race, we 
failed to take care about the surroundings in which we live in. Thus, we polluted 
the environment and thereby reducing the quality of the place we live. Even 
though there are several aspects of pollution such as soil, air and water 
pollution, out of these air pollution acts as the serious aspect as the other can 
detected visually and by taste, but the polluted air cannot be detected as it can 
be odourless, tasteless and colourless. 
Therefore, there is a growing demand for the environmental pollution 
monitoring and control systems. In the view of the ever-increasing pollution 
sources with toxic chemicals, these systems should have the facilities to detect 
and quantify the sources rapidly. Toxic gases are one that causes serious health 
impacts have to be monitored; such that increase in the normal level of them 
could be known and proper precaution measures can be taken. But the current 
systems available are not so portable and are costly and difficult to implement.
If these hazardous gases level exceeds normal level then the LEDs glow 
immediately. The system is affordable and can be easily implement in the in 
residential areas which is surrounded by the chemical industries or plants, to 
avoid endangering of human lives. 
The system also supports to provide real-time monitoring of 
concentration of some particular gases which are present in the air. As this 
method is automatic the information can be given in time such that the 
endangering of human lives can be avoided and preventive measures can be 
taken. As we know that ‘prevention is better than cure’.
